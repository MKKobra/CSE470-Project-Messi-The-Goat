        Messi achieved what Maradona did in 1986 and dominated a World Cup for Argentina. He scored seven goals and embraced the responsibility of leading his team out of those dark moments after a shocking 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia in the group stage.<br>

Playing in the spirit of Maradona, Messi coupled his dazzling skills with rarely seen aggression and led Argentina to the title by becoming the first man in a single edition of the World Cup to score in the group stage and then in every round of the knockout stage.

        He was able to make decisions despite, or maybe even because of, the times when he appeared to be walking through matches. He became the only person to ever score in both the group stage and all four knockout rounds of a World Cup.<br><br>
Total: seven goals. The only thing stopping Mbappe from being the first player to win the Golden Boot, the Golden Ball, and lift the trophy as captain was his late penalty. He had the most shots, second-most chances, and third-most completed dribbles during the competition.</b><br><br>
